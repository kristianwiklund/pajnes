## Consuming Data

The default behavior is to listen for messages from an [ESPHome P1 Reader](https://github.com/psvanstrom/esphome-p1reader).

Implemented: The app itself consumes the message *esp-p1reader/sensor/momentary_active_import/state* and displays the payload on the first page (the power gauge page).

Will be implemented:_All_ messages from the esp-p1reader are stored in an influxd database, using a [telegraf-influxd](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/mqtt-topic-payload-parsing-telegraf/) setup.
